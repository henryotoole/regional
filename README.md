# regional
A loose collection of code surrounding a personal design philosophy - discipline over dogma.

The regional model is, at heart, a collection of utilities built around a personal design philosophy and personal needs. For me, it fills the role which most fill with web frameworks. Developing with regional is probably not better and certainly not faster than using a real framework. However, building tooling like this from scratch has made me both a better programmer and thinker.

The philosophy behind regional can be painted in several broad brushstrokes:
+ Use MVC, use MVC, use MVC
+ Write code that runs 'natively' on the web.
+ Avoid dependency bloat (in 2024 it takes 5MB of javascript to perform a google search. This is ridiculous)
+ Minimal dev environment
